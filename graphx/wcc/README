PART C

    For clarity/ease of use in testing, all of part C was written in a single file.
    On a high level, the code (available in graphx/src/main/scala/SimpleApp.scala) creates a graph,
        and then performs the transformations necessary to the run each problem.
    1. RDDs are created from HDFS for the 200 batches
    2. These RDDs are turned into vertices (each vertex has an attribute which equals the word count).
    3. The edges are created
        This is done by two loops. 
        The first loop is over all RDDS.
            The second loop is from the first RDD to all later RDDs.
            For each pair, the intersection of the two RDDS is calculated. If not empty, there is a common word, and an edge is added.

    4. The graph is created from the vertices and edges created above.
